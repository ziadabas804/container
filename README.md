# `container`

`container` is a tool that you can use to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines on your Mac. It's written in Swift, and optimized for Apple silicon.

The tool consumes and produces [OCI-compatible container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec), so you can pull and run images from any standard container registry. You can push images that you build to those registries as well, and run the images in any other OCI-compatible application.

`container` uses the [Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) Swift package for low level container, image, and process management.

## Get started

### Requirements

You need a Mac with Apple silicon to run `container`. To build it, see the [BUILDING](./BUILDING.md) document.

`container` is supported on macOS 26, since it takes advantage of new features and enhancements to virtualization and networking in this release. We do not support older versions of macOS and the `container` maintainers typically will not address issues that cannot be reproduced on the macOS 26.

### Install or upgrade

If you're upgrading, first stop and uninstall your existing `container` (the `-k` flag keeps your user data, while `-d` removes it):

```bash
container system stop
uninstall-container.sh -k
```
((delate))
Download the latest signed installer package for `container` from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/apple/container/releases).

To install the tool, double-click the package file and follow the instructions. Enter your administrator password when prompted, to give the installer permission to place the installed files under `/usr/local`.

Start the system service with:

```bash
container system start
```

### Uninstall

Use the `uninstall-container.sh` script to remove `container` from your system. To remove your user data along with the tool, run:

```bash
uninstall-container.sh -d
```

To retain your user data so that it is available should you reinstall later, run:

```bash
uninstall-container.sh -k
```

## Project Status

The container project is currently under active development. Its stability, both for consuming the project as a Swift package and the `container` tool, is only guaranteed within patch versions, such as between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2. Minor version number releases may include breaking changes until we achieve a 1.0.0 release.
